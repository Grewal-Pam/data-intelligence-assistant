# Glossary

## Longitudinal Study
A longitudinal study follows the same participants over time and collects
data at multiple time points (e.g., baseline and follow-up visits).
This allows researchers to study changes and trends rather than single
snapshots.

---

## Cohort Study
A cohort study observes a defined group of participants who share common
characteristics (such as age or location) and tracks outcomes over time.
Cohort studies are commonly used in epidemiology and public health research.

---

## Baseline Visit
The baseline visit is the participant’s first assessment in a study.
It represents the reference point against which future measurements
are compared.

---

## Follow-up Visit
A follow-up visit is any study visit that occurs after the baseline visit.
Follow-up data is used to assess changes over time.

---

## BMI (Body Mass Index)
Body Mass Index (BMI) is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height
in meters squared (kg/m²). It is commonly used to categorize individuals as
underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

---

## BMI Change
BMI change represents the difference between BMI measured at follow-up and
BMI measured at baseline. A negative value indicates weight loss, while a
positive value indicates weight gain.

---

## Systolic Blood Pressure
Systolic blood pressure measures the pressure in the arteries when the heart
contracts (beats).

---

## Diastolic Blood Pressure
Diastolic blood pressure measures the pressure in the arteries when the heart
rests between beats.

---

## Smoking Status
Smoking status is a categorical variable indicating whether a participant
is a smoker or non-smoker at the time of data collection.

---

## Missing Data
Missing data refers to values that are unavailable or unknown.
In curated datasets, missing values are typically represented as NULL to
avoid misleading analyses.

---

## Visit-Level Data
Visit-level data refers to measurements or responses that are associated with
a specific study visit rather than being static participant attributes.

---

## Derived Variable
A derived variable is a value calculated from raw measurements, such as BMI
derived from height and weight.
