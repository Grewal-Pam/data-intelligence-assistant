# Query Layer

This directory contains validated SQL queries used to support
quality control and scientific analysis.

## QC Queries
Used to verify structural correctness and data completeness
before analysis.

## Analysis Queries
Reusable, documented queries that support longitudinal and
cross-sectional scientific questions.

All queries assume:
- visits are the temporal anchor
- measurements are visit-linked
- derived values are reproducible
